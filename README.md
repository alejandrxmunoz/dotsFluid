## Overview

DotsFluid is a generative animation based on a synchronized field of digital particles that behave like a fluid in constant transformation. The work explores chromatic vibration, controlled randomness, and the tension between order and noise.

The piece runs autonomously and is intended for continuous projection in exhibition spaces.

## Conceptual Notes

By manipulating a simple set of parameters, the user can directly influence the behavior of an array of synchronized dots, generating complex and fluid visual patterns in real time. The core system is responsive and intuitive, giving immediate feedback to every adjustment. The design emphasizes the relationship between user input and visual output, offering a hands-on, evolving digital environment.
